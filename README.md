# PyTorch FEA

The repo has the refactored code of our paper published at Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine, titled "**PyTorch-FEA: Autograd-enabled Finite Element Analysis Methods with Applications for Biomechanical Analysis of Human Aorta**"
I am working to make it useful for more applicaitons.

The orignal code of the paper is available at https://github.com/liangbright/pytorch_fea_paper

The preprint of our paper is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.27.533816v1

PyTorch-FEA needs the mesh library at https://github.com/liangbright/mesh
